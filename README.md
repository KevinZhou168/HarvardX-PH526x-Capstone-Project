# HarvardX-PH526x-Capstone-Project

Used Python to develop a statistical model that classifies different types of physical activity (e.g., walking, climbing stairs) from tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data. Smartphone accelerometers are very precise, so different physical activities are classified by different patterns of acceleration.

I first cleaned the given data and then proceeded to test three different methods of statistical modeling:
1) KNN (k-nearest neighbors)
2) Multimodal Logistic Regression
3) Random Forest

Ultimately, KNN was determined to be the most accurate classifier of physical activity.
